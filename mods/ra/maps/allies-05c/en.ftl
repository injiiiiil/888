briefing = Rescue Tanya.

    Once disguised, your spy can move past any enemy unit, except dogs, without being detected. Direct him into the weapons factory located at a nearby Soviet Base where he will hijack a truck and free Tanya.

    With Tanya's help, take out the air defenses on the island and a Chinook will arrive to rescue her.

    Then destroy all remaining Soviet buildings and units.
