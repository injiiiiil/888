## rules.yaml
briefing = Bring the Atreides forces up to combat strength - quickly. Guard against surprise attacks and ensure Spice production.

    The Ordos forces are light but numerous. To combat the Ordos, you have been granted license to produce Quads, which have a greater anti-vehicle capability than Trikes. Upgrade your Light Factories to allow production of these units.

    Meet any aggression with overwhelming force.

    Good luck.
